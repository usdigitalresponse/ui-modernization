# Landscape of the Employer Experience: User Interviews

## Summary

We conducted interviews with 6 HR and payroll professions to learn about the way they interact with unemployment insurance agencies and systems; they collectively had experience with 15 states' systems. 

All of them had to come up with their own ways to check their company's records with what the UI agency sent them, and they had difficulty at times in most states sending information back to the agency (the form did not meet their needs, or they were unsure if they were filling it out correctly). The amount of paper to track in non-digitized systems is astronomical, but the digitized systems also have their own challenges for responding to and tracking claims.
