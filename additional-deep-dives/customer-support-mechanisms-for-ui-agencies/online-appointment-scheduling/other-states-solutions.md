# Other states’ solutions

#### UI Agency self scheduling

In a survey of other states’ Departments of Labor / Unemployment Insurance Departments, we found two with easily accessible online appointment/callback scheduling. 

* **Colorado: **Leverages YouCanBook.me ([https://youcanbook.me/](https://youcanbook.me)): see it embedded at the bottom of [their contact page](https://cdle.colorado.gov/unemployment/contact-us) even when appointments don’t exist. They do not mention when new appointment slots are made available, but none were available every time we’ve checked.
* **Michigan:** They use Acuity ([https://acuityscheduling.com/](https://acuityscheduling.com)): They also have a [separate page](https://uiaappointmentscheduling.as.me/schedule.php) for the scheduler; unlike Alabama and Georgia, it still lets you start the process of finding an appointment slot even if none exist. They say, “New appointments become available throughout the day exactly 7 calendar days in advance (for example, on a Tuesday morning appointments for the following Tuesday morning become available).” None have been available any time we’ve checked.

Two other states have systems in place that seem to target the same solution area: the phone lines are long and unpredictable, so having known times makes the experience better for some.

* **Alabama:** Alabama’s tool takes basic constituent information and assigns them a time and location (theirs is not for callbacks but actual in-person appointments). You can see it [on this page](https://labor.alabama.gov/CLAIMSCHEDULER), but it’s unlikely to show you much unless it’s a Friday afternoon at 5PM CT when they’ve opened up new time slots.
* **Georgia:** It is not clear what Georgia’s functionality is or how they’ve implemented it, as no appointment slots have been available on the [separate page](https://appointment.gdol.ga.gov/schedule-appointment/) they built. It’s clear that going through that flow will result in some kind of appointment made, but not apparent how that appointment time is chosen/set. New appointments are released Monday mornings at 8 AM ET.

Since this survey was initially published in early Dec. 2020, Connecticut and Kentucky have added online appointment scheduling, but those have not been looked into.

#### Other states’ departmental solutions

Potentially interesting to you is how state Departments of Motor Vehicles or Departments of Licensing have implemented their online scheduling systems, as their use case is similar to UI agencies (e.g., the need to collect enough information to know who a constituent is, there’s a known number of appointments available per time slot, and it doesn’t matter within a group whom a constituent speaks with).
