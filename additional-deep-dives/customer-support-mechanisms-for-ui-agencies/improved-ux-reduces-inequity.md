# Improved UX reduces inequity

Phone lines, or other high-touch customer support channels like in-person appointments when safe, are an important part of the UI system; there are some kinds of issues that can only be solved via a synchronous, human-to-human conversation. They are even more important for those with lower digital fluency or less internet access.

Black and Latinx adults are [2-3 times less likely](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018161.pdf) than their White counterparts to be digitally literate. Having a better user experience, including the use of [plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov) (both in English and when translated), not only increases the likelihood that everyone can effectively navigate the UI system on their own, but it also reduces the need for high-touch customer support channels for those with higher digital literacy. [Chatbots](https://usdr.gitbook.io/unemployment-insurance-moderinzation/additional-deep-dives/customer-support-mechanisms-for-ui-agencies/customer-support-online-chatting) and other digital self-services to answer questions or resolve issues would be similarly helpful. 

The improved UX needs to include clear designs for mobile devices. Black and Latinx adults are [25% less likely](https://www.nelp.org/publication/from-disrepair-to-transformation-how-to-revive-unemployment-insurance-information-technology-infrastructure/) than White adults to own a laptop or desktop computer, an inequity which is compounded by the closing of libraries and other public spaces where such devices are typically available.
