# Prompted chat

"Prompted" chat is when people are presented with a series of options for what they can get help with. The options are frequently structured as a decision tree, with sub-questions for the primary scenarios. This chat seems to always come with f-text chat, so you can get all the pros (and cons) of that, though the intended primary interaction is for the user to click buttons within the chat window rather than typing anything into the chat box.

* **Pros:**
  * You can configure the flow to answer the most common questions
  * People have clear expectations of what they can get help with
  * Content is created specifically with the chat format in mind
* **Cons:**
  * Without careful set up, it is very easy to create "dead ends" for people seeking help.
* **Vendors:**
  * AWS/Accenture
  * Google
  * IBM
  * Microsoft
  * Salesforce
  * Twilio
