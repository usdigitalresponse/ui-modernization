# Methodology

We looked at each state's UI agency government website, and in some cases non-governmental but official websites that people would be directed to in order to learn about or apply for or manage unemployment claims. In many cases, we took screenshots for easy reference for myself; this also has the effect of documenting some changes over time.

Once a chat functionality was found, we used the Chrome browser's Developer Tools to find evidence of which vendor was used to provide it. With this method, we were unable to determine the vendors used in Kansas, Massachusetts, and Maryland. Vendors may have more chat-related offerings than are mentioned here; this document is not intended to be a comprehensive vendor analysis.
