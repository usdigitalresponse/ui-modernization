# Race and inequity in identity proofing methods

## Introduction

The vast fraud committed through the use of stolen and synthetic identities in UI programs has spotlighted the need for updated identity fraud detection mechanisms. The Dec. 2020 Continued Assistance Act mandated states make such a change for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance in particular. As States are implementing new technologies and systems, they need to consider the ways in which they are impacting racial inequities in UI benefits. States can do this by:

1. Finding and mitigating the ways in which their identity fraud detection flags will disproportionately affect POC
2. Increasing accountability for ensuring rightful claimants make it through the system
