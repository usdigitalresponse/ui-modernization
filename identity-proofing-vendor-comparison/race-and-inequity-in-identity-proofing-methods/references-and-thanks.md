All sources are linked inline. I particularly want to call out the phenomenal and in-depth research in New America's Public Interest Technology New Practice Lab's [Unpacking Inequities in Unemployment Insurance](https://www.newamerica.org/pit/reports/unpacking-inequities-unemployment-insurance/) report, September 2020, in particular [Section 3: A Focus on Fraud Over Accessibility: The Punitive Design of UI](https://www.newamerica.org/pit/reports/unpacking-inequities-unemployment-insurance/a-focus-on-fraud-over-accessibility-the-punitive-design-of-ui/).

Thanks also to Robin Carnahan, Sara Hudson, Waldo Jaquith, Julia Simon-Mishel, and Sam Zeitlin for the knowledge they shared with me in conversations.
