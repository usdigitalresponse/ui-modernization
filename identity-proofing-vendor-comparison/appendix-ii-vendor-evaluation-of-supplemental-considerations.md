# Appendix II: Vendor Evaluation of Supplemental Considerations

For more information on each item, please see [Supplemental Considerations](https://usdr.gitbook.io/unemployment-insurance-moderinzation/identity-proofing-vendor-comparison/identity-proofing-vendor-comparison#supplemental-considerations).

Note: as none of the evaluated vendors are under a recognized socioeconomic program or status, that information isn’t duplicated in the chart below. For some of the vendors, the answer is “unknown,” and we continue working to try to find that information.\
